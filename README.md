## Aviation Risk Analysis for Aircraft Procurement

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide data-driven insights into aviation safety, specifically focusing on identifying **lowest-risk aircraft** for a company expanding its operations into commercial and private aviation. Leveraging historical accident data, the analysis informs strategic aircraft procurement decisions, helping to mitigate potential risks and ensure a safe, reliable fleet.

## Business Problem

Our company is venturing into a new, high-stakes domain: the acquisition and operation of airplanes for commercial and private purposes. A significant challenge is the inherent lack of expertise within the organization regarding the safety profiles and potential risks associated with different aircraft types. Without this critical understanding, strategic procurement decisions are difficult, potentially leading to unforeseen operational hazards and significant liabilities.

This project addresses the core business problem of providing the **Head of the New Aviation Division** with concrete, data-backed recommendations on which aircraft makes and models represent the lowest risk profile, thereby enabling informed and safety-conscious investment.

## Project Goal

To analyze comprehensive civil aviation accident data to:
* Quantify and compare the risk associated with various aircraft manufacturers and models.
* Identify key trends and contextual factors influencing aviation accidents.
* Deliver actionable recommendations for aircraft procurement that prioritize safety and minimize operational risk.

## Data Source

The primary dataset used for this analysis is `AviationData.csv`, sourced from the **National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)**. The NTSB is an independent U.S. government agency responsible for investigating civil aviation accidents. This dataset provides rich details on accident events, including:
* Date and location of the event
* Aircraft category, make, and model
* Injury outcomes (fatal, serious, minor)
* Aircraft damage severity
* Purpose of flight, phase of flight, and weather conditions

This authoritative source ensures the reliability and suitability of the data for a comprehensive aviation risk assessment.

## Key Findings & Recommendations (Summary)


Our analysis reveals significant variations in safety performance across different aircraft manufacturers and operational contexts. Key insights include:

* **Leading Safety Performers: **177MF LLC**, **5 Rivers LLC**, and **67 Flying Duchtman** as consistently demonstrating lower fatal accident rates and reduced severe damage incidents among makes with substantial operational history.
* **Operational Risk Hotspots:** Accidents, particularly fatal ones, are disproportionately concentrated during specific flight phases such as **[e.g., Takeoff, Landing, Maneuvering]**, highlighting critical areas for operational safety focus.
* **Improving Industry Trend:** The overall fatal accident rate in general aviation has shown a [decreasing/stable] trend over the past decades, reflecting ongoing advancements in safety standards and technology.

**Recommendations for Aircraft Procurement:**
1.  **Prioritize aircraft from manufacturers like [Manufacturer A, B, C]** due to their demonstrably lower risk profiles.
2.  **Implement enhanced pilot training and operational protocols** focusing on high-risk flight phases to mitigate accident probabilities regardless of aircraft type.
3.  **Conduct deeper model-specific safety assessments
